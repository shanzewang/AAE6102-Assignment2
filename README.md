## Explanation of Key Comparison Factors

### Accuracy
DGNSS provides corrections enabling meter-range accuracy. RTK technology achieves centimeter-level results through phase measurement analysis. PPP delivers decimeter accuracy by utilizing precise orbital and timing data. The hybrid PPP-RTK approach combines methodologies for reliable centimeter-to-decimeter positioning.

### Convergence Time
DGNSS corrections are applied virtually immediately. RTK requires initialization periods for phase ambiguity resolution. PPP necessitates extended observation windows to achieve optimal accuracy. The hybrid PPP-RTK substantially reduces initialization periods through enhanced regional data integration.

### Hardware Compatibility
Most current mobile devices contain basic receivers suitable for DGNSS implementation. RTK, PPP, and PPP-RTK performance improves significantly with dual-frequency receivers, currently available only in premium mobile devices.

### Computational Demands and Battery Impact
DGNSS requires minimal computational resources. RTK processing demands moderate device capabilities. PPP and PPP-RTK involve sophisticated algorithms that challenge mobile processors and significantly increase energy consumption during continuous operation.

### Smartphone Integration Feasibility
DGNSS can be readily deployed on existing mobile hardware. RTK typically necessitates external hardware components for optimal results. PPP and PPP-RTK integration presents challenges related to mobile antenna limitations and processing constraints.

### Urban Performance
Built environments create substantial challenges for all satellite positioning technologies due to signal obstruction, reflection issues, and limited satellite visibility. DGNSS achieves adequate performance through atmospheric and satellite error correction, though multipath issues remain. RTK performs inconsistently in urban contexts due to carrier phase measurement disruptions and signal discontinuities caused by structures. PPP exhibits the poorest urban performance as its convergence process must restart after interruptions. PPP-RTK delivers improved urban results through enhanced regional augmentation and faster recovery capabilities.

## Analysis by Technique

### Differential GNSS (DGNSS)
DGNSS represents the most immediately viable solution for contemporary mobile implementation. Its compatibility with standard receivers, modest computational demands, and established correction infrastructure make it readily applicable to most devices. The adequate urban performance and meter-level accuracy suffice for numerous consumer navigation requirements.

### Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)
Despite superior accuracy, RTK deployment in mobile devices faces significant implementation barriers. The methodology's vulnerability to signal disruptions, substantial data requirements, and general dependence on external hardware limit its practical application for mainstream mobile navigation.

### Precise Point Positioning (PPP)
PPP eliminates dependence on localized reference infrastructure but suffers from extended initialization periods and poor performance in urban settings. These limitations, coupled with intensive computational requirements, render it currently unsuitable for typical mobile navigation scenarios requiring immediate positioning.

### PPP-RTK
This integrated approach represents a promising future direction, offering reduced initialization times compared to standard PPP and expanded coverage relative to RTK. As dual-frequency receivers become commonplace in mobile devices, the hybrid PPP-RTK methodology may provide an optimal balance of accuracy, coverage, and performance.

## Conclusion

For current smartphone navigation applications, DGNSS represents the most practical solution, balancing improved accuracy with feasible implementation requirements. As smartphone hardware evolves, PPP-RTK shows the greatest promise for future high-precision navigation applications, particularly as dual-frequency receivers become standard in consumer devices.
